				<h2>Price</h2>
				<p>
					If I had to make a comparison, I'd say <b>
					pricing (and building) a website is a lot like pricing
					(and building) a new home</b>
				</p>
				<p>
					Whether you buy a home from a new development,
					or have one custom built. The process is very 
					much like (and sometimes as complicated and as costly)
					as building a home.
				</p>
				<blockquote>
					pricing (and building) a website is like pricing (and building)
					a new home.
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					The reason it's so hard to simply give one a price 
					for a website is there are so many damn factors involved _
					even outside the technology (which matters A LOT!)
